# base-public-entropy-generator

## Project Overview: Free, Verifiable Entropy on Base

This repository contains the smart contract and documentation for the **EntropyGenerator**, a public utility deployed on the Base network. Its purpose is to provide a highly transparent and verifiable source of pseudo-randomness (entropy) for developers, artists, and dApps.

Since the function is non-payable, users pay only the minimal network gas fee associated with the Base chain.

### Deployed Contract Details

| Network | Contract Name | Contract Address (CA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Mainnet** | `EntropyGenerator` | `0xB7328ad52792550d74dF1960857F6c2C91` |

### Key Mechanism

The pseudo-random seed is generated by hashing the following core on-chain variables to ensure immutability and resistance to simple manipulation:

1.  `block.timestamp`
2.  `block.number`
3.  `msg.sender` (The caller's address)
4.  `tx.origin` (The transaction initiator's address)
5.  `blockhash(block.number - 1)` (The hash of the preceding block)

The combination of these elements provides a strong source of verifiable entropy. 

### Setup and Interaction

#### 1. Prerequisites

* A wallet configured for the Base network (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby).
* A small amount of Base ETH to cover transaction gas fees.

#### 2. Using the Contract

You can interact with the deployed contract directly via a Block Explorer (like Basescan) or through a web interface.

**Primary Function:**

* **`generateSeed()`:** Call this function to generate and record a new seed associated with your address. Pay only the network gas fee.

**Read Functions:**

* **`getSeed(address user)`:** Retrieves the last generated seed associated with the specified address.
